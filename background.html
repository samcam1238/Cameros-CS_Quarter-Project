        <b><h1>WHAT IS THE TOPIC ABOUT? </h1></b>
        <p>
            Based on our title, our dataset’s topic discusses which fashion brand’s 
            clothing would yield the most sales in the USA in 2023. In order to gather 
            that information, we needed these variables: product name, brand, price, 
            and rating (of the wearers, out of 5). Originally, the topic that we had 
            set out was completely different from this. There were complications about 
            the original topic that prompted us to change to another one. In order to 
            get data fast, we no longer conducted a survey (prior to the original topic, 
            we conducted two surveys, and getting respondents took too long). Instead, 
            we decided to source our new dataset from a platform known as Kaggle. 
            (Fashion Products, 2023). We chose the topic “Fashion Products” 
            because we have a great interest in fashion. Based on people's feedback, 
            this dataset helps us identify what brands and their products (clothing) are 
            the most recommended. Since all the prices were listed in US Dollars, we 
            inferred that the data was collected within the USA. Additionally, the last 
            update on the dataset was made four months ago, leading us to conclude that the 
            information was gathered this year. The data was gathered in the form of a survey. 
            Although the exact number of respondents wasn't mentioned, it is probable to 
            assume that they were most likely American individuals with an interest in fashion 
            and clothing. The sample size of this dataset is 1000. In order to obtain the data 
            from this data set, a survey has to be conducted to people who are interested in 
            fashion and willing to share their feedback with others. The qualitative variables 
            for this dataset are the product name (dress, jeans, shoes, sweater, t-shirt) and 
            brand (Adidas, Gucci, H&M, Nike, Zara). The quantitative variables for this dataset 
            are the price (of the product) and rating (feedback of the people from 1 being 
            the lowest to 5 being the highest).
